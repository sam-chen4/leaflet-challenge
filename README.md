Earthquake Data Visualization with Leaflet
This project is a web-based application that visualizes earthquake data using the Leaflet.js library. The data is sourced from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program, providing a real-time overview of seismic activity around the globe. The visualization allows users to explore earthquake occurrences, magnitudes, and depths interactively on a map.

Features
Interactive map displaying earthquake locations based on latitude and longitude.
Markers are styled dynamically:
Size: Represents the magnitude of the earthquake.
Color: Represents the depth of the earthquake. Darker colors indicate greater depth.
Popups for each marker provide detailed information, including the magnitude, location, and depth of the earthquake.
A legend in the bottom-right corner explains the color scheme used for depth visualization.
Users can switch between two map views:
Grayscale: A simple, high-contrast map view.
Satellite: A topographical map view.
Overlay options allow users to toggle the visibility of:
Tectonic Plates: Visualizes tectonic plate boundaries on the map.
Earthquakes: Toggles the display of earthquake markers.
Technologies Used
Leaflet.js: An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
D3.js: A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, data-driven visualizations in web browsers.
HTML/CSS: Standard web technologies for structuring and styling the application.
